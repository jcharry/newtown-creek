Its foliage reduces wakes and its presence can improve nutrient imbalances.  Compare this soft boundary to the ubiquitous, impenetrable bulkheads.'],\n            D: ['D.

Mussels (Animals)', 'Ribbed Mussels have been incorporated into remediation efforts, such as the Newtown Creek Alliance\\'s Living Dock, due to their ability to filter out phytoplankton and excessive debris. Along with other species like oysters and clams, they have been losing habitat, but their renewed presence on the Creek is a hopeful sign.  Find them when the tide is right, occupying the triangular bays cut into the steps.'],\n            F: ['F. Killifish (Animals)', 'It may be a surprise that today you could see a fish in Newtown Creek, and tomorrow you could see it in your neighbor\\'s aquarium.

Since 1930 the NYC DEP has operated \"sludge boats\" to transport approximately that amount per year of soupy organic residue from the wastewater treatment process.

Japanese Knotweed (Plants)', 'We all want to see more plant life along Newtown Creek, and flowers enliven its often dull shorelines.  But the small greenish-white blooms of Japanese Knotweed that appear in late summer warn of an invasive species that can grow upright 10 to 15 feet, forming dense thickets that can crowd out native plants and break through sidewalks.'],\n            L: ['L. Algal Mat (Toxins / Pollutants)', 'Tarpaper-like forms you may observe adrift on the water are actually laminated cyanobacterial algae and sediment. Their appearance may be stimulated by raw sewage outflow, which induces blooms of algae, or they may break off from the Creek bottom by oxygen bubbling.  Oxygen-poor conditions due to CSOs produce more of these questionable \"welcome mats.\"'],\n            M: ['M.
