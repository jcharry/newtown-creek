                <p>We strongly believe that the innovative, hybrid methods of socially engaged art can emotionally connect people to issues that are commonly presented didactically. With the Superfund assessment nearly completed, it is time to expand citizen awareness in Newtown Creek, and encourage people to co-determine its near future before decisions that will impact their interests are made without their input. Because the Creek is a toxic working waterway, many people are deterred from considering their stake in its future. And yet improved health and safety, green spaces for recreational boaters and non-human animals, and a better of quality of life for long-time residents and the labor force who work on and near the Creek are within reach, given citizen participation in the process of its evolution.
